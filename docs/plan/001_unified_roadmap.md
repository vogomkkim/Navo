| Focus Area | Key Deliverables |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Code Generation & Live Preview** | - **Project Scaffolding**: Auto-generate file/directory structure and install dependencies. <br> - **Backend Code Generator**: "Compile" the AI's API plan into functional Node.js/Express endpoints. <br> - **Frontend Code Generator**: "Compile" the AI's UI plan into functional React components. <br> - **DB & Deployment Integration**: Auto-migrate the DB schema and deploy the full-stack app to a live preview URL on Render/Vercel. |
| **2. Orchestrator Enhancement** | - **Dynamic Task Generation**: Implement the core logic for the AI to decompose user requests into executable DAGs. <br> - **Dependency Management**: Build the system for managing dependencies between tasks in a plan. <br> - **Advanced Error Handling**: Implement robust retry, rollback, and recovery mechanisms. |
| **3. Feature Maturation** | - **Advanced AI Suggestions (v2)**: Introduce suggestions for SEO, performance, and content optimization. <br> - **Template Library**: Allow users to start from and save project templates. |
| **4. Platform Foundation** | - **Authentication & Payments**: Implement a secure auth system and integrate a payment gateway for monetization. <br> - **Sharing & QR Codes**: Add features to easily share published sites. |

## Technical Deployment Strategy

The deployment architecture is a key part of our strategy. For full details, please refer to the **[Platform Configuration & Deployment Strategy](./archive/platform-deployment-strategy.md)** document (this will be archived but remains relevant).

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js, deployed on **Vercel** for its global CDN and performance.
- **Backend (BFF & Core Services)**: Node.js (and future Go services), deployed on **Render** for its flexibility with web services and managed databases.
