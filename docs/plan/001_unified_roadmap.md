| **1. Blueprint-driven Code Generation** | - **Blueprint (IR) Schema Definition**: Formalize the framework-agnostic JSON schema for describing application structure and logic. <br> ‚úÖ _Confirmed by Gemini on 2025-09-16: The schema exists at `packages/shared/src/project-blueprint.schema.ts` and is sufficient for the next steps._ <br> - **Blueprint-driven Scaffolding**: Implement the workflow where the AI Planner (`projectArchitect` tool) generates a complete project Blueprint (IR). <br> ‚úÖ _Confirmed by Gemini on 2025-09-16: This is handled by the AI Planner in `workflow.service.ts` which generates a plan to run the `scaffold_project_from_blueprint` tool._ <br> - **Blueprint-to-React Compiler**: Develop the first "compiler" tool that takes the Blueprint (IR) as input and generates functional React/Next.js components and file structure into the VFS. <br> ‚úÖ _Confirmed by Gemini on 2025-09-16: This is the `scaffold_project_from_blueprint` tool located in `projectScaffolder.tool.ts`, which recursively creates VFS nodes from the blueprint's file structure._ <br> - **Live Preview Integration**: Connect the generated VFS content to a live preview environment. | ‚úÖ Done  |
| **2. Orchestrator Enhancement**         | - **Real-time Workflow Streaming**: Stream the progress of plan execution (step start, completion, errors) in real-time via SSE. <br> ‚úÖ _This was an undocumented feature, now confirmed. Implemented via \`connectionManager\` in \`workflow.controller.ts\`._ <br> - **Dynamic Task Generation**: Implement the core logic for the AI to decompose user requests into executable DAGs. <br> ‚úÖ _Completed on 2025-01-27: Enhanced AI planner with advanced DAG optimization, conditional execution, and retry policies._ <br> - **Dependency Management**: Build the system for managing dependencies between tasks in a plan. <br> ‚úÖ _Completed on 2025-01-27: Advanced dependency analyzer with circular dependency detection, topological sorting, and parallel execution optimization._ <br> - **Advanced Error Handling**: Implement robust retry, rollback, and recovery mechanisms. <br> ‚úÖ _Completed on 2025-01-27: Comprehensive rollback manager with checkpoint system, recovery strategies, and automatic cleanup._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ‚úÖ Done  |
| **3. Feature Maturation**               | - **Advanced AI Suggestions (v2)**: Introduce suggestions for SEO, performance, and content optimization. <br> - **Template Library**: Allow users to start from and save project templates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | üìù To Do |

## Technical Deployment Strategy

The deployment architecture is a key part of our strategy. For full details, please refer to the **[Platform Configuration & Deployment Strategy](./archive/platform-deployment-strategy.md)** document (this will be archived but remains relevant).

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js, deployed on **Vercel** for its global CDN and performance.
- **Backend (BFF & Core Services)**: Node.js (and future Go services), deployed on **Render** for its flexibility with web services and managed databases.
