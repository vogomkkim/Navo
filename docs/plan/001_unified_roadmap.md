## Phase 2: Private Beta (In Progress)

**Goal:** Evolve the MVP into a robust product for a small group of beta users. The primary focus is on turning the AI's generated plan into a live, interactive application.

| Focus Area | Key Deliverables | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Blueprint-driven Code Generation** | - **Blueprint (IR) Schema Definition**: Formalize the framework-agnostic JSON schema for describing application structure and logic. <br> - **Blueprint-driven Scaffolding**: Implement the workflow where the AI Planner (`projectArchitect` tool) generates a complete project Blueprint (IR). <br> - **Blueprint-to-React Compiler**: Develop the first "compiler" tool that takes the Blueprint (IR) as input and generates functional React/Next.js components and file structure into the VFS. <br> - **Live Preview Integration**: Connect the generated VFS content to a live preview environment. | üîÑ In Progress |
| **2. Orchestrator Enhancement** | - **Dynamic Task Generation**: Implement the core logic for the AI to decompose user requests into executable DAGs. <br> - **Dependency Management**: Build the system for managing dependencies between tasks in a plan. <br> - **Advanced Error Handling**: Implement robust retry, rollback, and recovery mechanisms. | üìù To Do |
| **3. Feature Maturation** | - **Advanced AI Suggestions (v2)**: Introduce suggestions for SEO, performance, and content optimization. <br> - **Template Library**: Allow users to start from and save project templates. | üìù To Do |
| **4. Platform Foundation** | - **Authentication & Payments**: Implement a secure auth system and integrate a payment gateway for monetization. <br> - **Sharing & QR Codes**: Add features to easily share published sites. | üìù To Do |

## Technical Deployment Strategy

The deployment architecture is a key part of our strategy. For full details, please refer to the **[Platform Configuration & Deployment Strategy](./archive/platform-deployment-strategy.md)** document (this will be archived but remains relevant).

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js, deployed on **Vercel** for its global CDN and performance.
- **Backend (BFF & Core Services)**: Node.js (and future Go services), deployed on **Render** for its flexibility with web services and managed databases.
