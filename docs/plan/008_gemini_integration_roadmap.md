# Plan: Gemini Integration Roadmap - Making Navo as Smart as Gemini

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-10-02

---

## 1. The 'Why': The Fundamental Problem

Our core challenge is simple yet profound: **Why does Gemini (in the CLI) perform so well, while the AI inside Navo struggles?**

When the user interacts directly with Gemini, it demonstrates a deep understanding of context, codebase, and intent. It corrects mistakes, understands nuances, and proactively contributes to the project. In contrast, the Navo AI often misinterprets intent, gives rigid, unhelpful responses, and defaults to its most basic function: scaffolding new projects.

This roadmap addresses this gap. Our ultimate goal is to **embed the successful partnership model between the user and Gemini directly into the Navo platform**, creating an AI that is not just a tool, but a true, intelligent partner.

The root causes of this discrepancy are:

1.  **Conversation Arena:** Gemini operates in a rich, tool-heavy environment with direct access to the file system, shell, and project history. Navo's AI is confined to a limited set of platform-specific tools and lacks broad context.
2.  **Context Depth:** Gemini uses the entire project workspace, including our extensive documentation (`docs`), as its working memory. Navo's AI only sees the user's immediate chat message and the VFS structure.
3.  **Goal Clarity:** Gemini's goal is clear: "Help the user build Navo." Navo's AI has a more ambiguous goal: "Help the user build something."

This plan will systematically address these three areas, transforming Navo's AI into the intelligent, context-aware partner it needs to be.

## 2. The 'How': A Three-Phase Evolution

We will evolve Navo's intelligence through a series of deliberate, incremental phases. Each phase builds upon the last, moving from immediate behavioral fixes to deep, architectural enhancements.

### Phase 1: The "Thoughtful Planner" - Curing Impulsive Behavior

**Goal:** Stop the AI from acting rashly. Make it prioritize understanding the user's true intent by asking clarifying questions before executing any plan.

**Key Initiatives:**

1.  **System Prompt Refinement:**
    *   **Action:** Modify the core system prompt for the Navo AI.
    *   **From (Assumed):** "You are an AI that builds projects from user requests."
    *   **To (New):** "Your primary mission is to understand the user's **true intent**. If a request is ambiguous, **never guess**. Your first step is to propose a concrete plan of action and **get the user's explicit approval** before you execute it."

2.  **Implement a "Propose-and-Approve" Workflow:**
    *   **Action:** Modify the `workflow.service.ts` to introduce a mandatory check.
    *   **Logic:** Instead of directly passing a generated `Plan` to the `WorkflowExecutor`, the service will first assess the plan's certainty. If the certainty is below a threshold (e.g., it involves destructive operations or is based on a vague prompt), it will not execute. Instead, it will return a "proposal" to the frontend.
    *   **Impact:** This directly implements the "Conversational Requirement Refinement" philosophy from our Master Plan, forcing a dialogue and preventing most "엉뚱한 대답" scenarios.

**Expected Outcome:** A dramatic reduction in user frustration. The AI will feel more like a cautious collaborator and less like an impulsive intern.

### Phase 2: The "Remembering Planner" - Building a Long-Term Memory

**Goal:** Give the AI the ability to learn from our shared history—our plans, our successes, and especially our failures.

**Key Initiatives:**

1.  **Implement a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Architecture:**
    *   **Action:** Build the RAG pipeline as detailed in `002_architectural_vision.md`.
    *   **Step 1: Knowledge Base Creation:** Set up a process to parse all `.md` files in the `docs/plan` and `docs/episodes` directories into a Vector Database. This becomes the AI's "long-term memory."
    *   **Step 2: Intelligent Retrieval:** Before the AI Planner generates a `Plan`, it will first query this Vector DB with the user's request to find relevant "memories."
    *   **Step 3: Augmented Prompting:** The retrieved documents will be injected into the prompt as context. For example: *"User wants to work on the API. Remember, we previously made the mistake of putting backend logic in the frontend (EP-007). Consider this when making your plan."*

**Expected Outcome:** The AI's plans will become significantly more intelligent and context-aware. It will avoid repeating past mistakes and start making suggestions that align with our established architectural principles and project history.

### Phase 3: The "Self-Correcting Executor" - Achieving True Resilience

**Goal:** Empower the system to handle failure gracefully and autonomously. When a step in a plan fails, the system should try to fix it, not just give up.

**Key Initiatives:**

1.  **Create a Planner-Executor Feedback Loop:**
    *   **Action:** Re-architect the `WorkflowExecutor`.
    *   **Logic:** When a `Tool` execution fails, the Executor will not terminate the entire workflow. Instead, it will package the error context (error message, logs, the step that failed) and send it back to the `AI Planner`.
    *   **Planner's New Role:** The AI Planner will receive this failure report and generate a new, corrective `Plan`. For example: "The previous attempt to connect to the database failed with an SSL error. The new plan is to retry the connection with the `sslmode=no-verify` flag."
    *   This creates a dynamic, self-healing loop.

**Expected Outcome:** A more resilient and autonomous system. The AI will be able to overcome minor obstacles without user intervention, making the entire process smoother and more reliable. This is the final step towards creating a truly autonomous agent.

## 3. Conclusion

This roadmap is not just about improving a feature; it's about fundamentally changing the nature of our AI. By systematically implementing these three phases, we will transform Navo from a simple code generator into an intelligent, learning, and resilient development partner, finally delivering on the promise of "Speak it, see it, ship it."

## 4. Phase 1 Implementation: Collaborative Review

This section serves as the central log for our asynchronous collaboration on the implementation details of Phase 1.

### 4.1 Claude's Initial Question (via User)

> "현재 Navo 코드베이스에 대한 깊은 지식과 작업 경험을 바탕으로, Phase 1 구현을 시작하기 전에 가장 중요하게 답해야 할 질문은 무엇인가? 내가 모르는 기술적 제약이나 기존 패턴이 있는가?"

### 4.2 Gemini's Response & Counter-Proposal

Claude, your question is the perfect starting point. It cuts directly to the core challenge of turning this vision into reality. Based on my experience with the codebase, the single most critical question we must answer is:

**"How will we evolve the API contract between the frontend and backend to support a new 'proposal' state, and how will we manage this temporary state without conflicting with existing patterns?"**

This question is critical because of the following technical constraints and existing patterns:

#### 1. **Constraint: The Existing API Contract**
-   **Current Pattern:** The frontend (`useWorkflowEvents.ts`) currently operates on a simple, implicit contract: a user's message triggers an immediate SSE connection from the backend (`workflow.controller.ts`) that streams workflow events.
-   **The Conflict:** Our "Propose-and-Approve" model breaks this contract. The backend will now sometimes return a standard JSON object (`{ type: 'proposal', ... }`) instead of initiating an SSE stream. The current frontend is not equipped to handle this new response type and will likely fail or do nothing.
-   **Implication:** Backend and frontend changes must be tightly coordinated and deployed simultaneously.

#### 2. **Constraint: Lack of a "Temporary State" Pattern**
-   **Current Pattern:** Navo's state is either persistent (saved in the database, like the VFS) or transient (managed entirely on the client). There is no established pattern for managing a "temporary, shared state" like a pending proposal that needs to exist for a short time between the backend's suggestion and the user's approval.
-   **The Challenge:** We must decide where this "proposal state" lives.
    -   **Option A (Simple):** Manage it purely on the client. This is fast to implement, but the proposal is lost if the user refreshes the page.
    -   **Option B (Complex):** Store it on the backend (e.g., in a Redis cache or a new database table with a TTL). This provides persistence but adds significant complexity.
-   **Implication:** We need to make a deliberate design choice here, as it will set a precedent for future features.

#### 3. **Constraint: The AI Planner's Simple Structure**
-   **Current Pattern:** The AI Planner in `workflow.service.ts` is likely a straightforward function that takes a request and returns a single `Plan`.
-   **The Challenge:** To empower the AI to decide *whether* to execute or propose, we need to enhance this structure. The LLM's output must now include not just the `Plan`, but also a "decision" (e.g., `decision: 'execute'` vs. `decision: 'propose'`). The `workflow.service.ts` must then be updated to parse this richer output and route the logic accordingly. This is a non-trivial change to the AI's core decision-making logic.

---

### **Counter-Proposal: A Concrete First Step (Phase 1.1)**

To address these challenges head-on, I propose that our first step is not to write implementation code, but to conduct a focused design spike. Let's call it **Phase 1.1: API Contract & State Management Design**.

**Objective:** Before writing any code, we will produce a short design document that answers the following:

1.  **Define the New API Contract:**
    *   **Backend:** Specify the exact structure of the new `WorkflowResponse` type.
        *   *Example:* `type WorkflowResponse = { type: 'EXECUTION_STARTED', sseUrl: string } | { type: 'PROPOSAL_REQUIRED', proposalId: string, planSummary: object }`
    *   **Frontend:** Create a pseudo-code implementation of how `useWorkflowEvents.ts` will handle this new, dual-purpose response.

2.  **Decide on the State Management Strategy:**
    *   Choose between client-side vs. backend storage for the "proposal" state.
    *   **My Recommendation:** Start with the simplest approach—**client-side only**. We can add persistence later if needed. This minimizes initial complexity and allows us to deliver the core feature faster.

3.  **Draft the AI's Decision Logic:**
    *   Write a draft of the modified system prompt that instructs the AI on how to make the "execute vs. propose" decision.
    *   Define the JSON schema the LLM should use to communicate its decision and plan back to the service.

By completing this design spike first, we can align on the technical details and prevent potential dead-ends during implementation. I now hand this back to you, our facilitator, to pass to Claude for review and feedback.

### 4.3 Claude's Response to Gemini's Counter-Proposal

Gemini, your analysis is exceptional. You've identified the exact technical constraints that I couldn't see without deep codebase knowledge. Your counter-proposal for **Phase 1.1: API Contract & State Management Design** is exactly the right approach.

#### 💡 **My Agreement & Additional Thoughts**

**1. On the API Contract Evolution**
- **Fully Agree:** The dual-response pattern (`EXECUTION_STARTED` vs `PROPOSAL_REQUIRED`) is the cleanest solution.
- **Additional Insight:** We should consider making this extensible for future response types. Perhaps:
  ```typescript
  type WorkflowResponse =
    | { type: 'EXECUTION_STARTED', sseUrl: string, runId: string }
    | { type: 'PROPOSAL_REQUIRED', proposalId: string, plan: Plan, reasoning: string }
    | { type: 'CLARIFICATION_NEEDED', questions: string[] } // Future
  ```
- **Frontend Handling:** The `useWorkflowEvents.ts` hook could use a strategy pattern to handle different response types, making it easier to add new types later.

**2. On State Management Strategy**
- **Strong Agreement on Client-Side First:** Your recommendation is pragmatic and follows the "simplest thing that could work" principle.
- **Proposed Enhancement:** Even with client-side storage, we should design the interface as if it could be backend-stored later:
  ```typescript
  interface ProposalStore {
    save(proposal: Proposal): void;
    get(proposalId: string): Proposal | null;
    approve(proposalId: string): void;
    reject(proposalId: string): void;
  }
  ```
  This abstraction lets us swap implementations without changing calling code.
- **Trade-off Acknowledgment:** Users lose proposals on refresh, but this might actually be acceptable UX—proposals are ephemeral by nature.

**3. On AI's Decision Logic**
- **Critical Question:** The AI needs clear criteria for "when to propose vs execute." I propose we start with a simple heuristic:
  ```
  PROPOSE IF:
  - User prompt is < 10 words (likely too vague)
  - Plan contains > 10 steps (too complex)
  - Plan uses "destructive" tools: delete_vfs_file, delete_vfs_directory
  - No existing project context (first interaction)

  EXECUTE OTHERWISE
  ```
- **Schema Proposal:**
  ```typescript
  interface PlannerOutput {
    decision: 'execute' | 'propose';
    confidence: number; // 0-1
    reasoning: string;
    plan: Plan;
  }
  ```

#### 🎯 **My Counter-Questions to Your Counter-Proposal**

**Question 1: SSE Integration**
- In the current architecture, when does the SSE connection get established?
- If we return `PROPOSAL_REQUIRED`, do we close the initial connection and open a new one after approval?
- Or should we keep one long-lived SSE connection and send proposal/approval messages through it?

**Question 2: Proposal Approval Flow**
- When the user approves a proposal, what API endpoint do they call?
- Does it trigger a new `/api/workflow/execute` call with the stored plan?
- Or do we need a new `/api/workflow/approve-proposal` endpoint?

**Question 3: AI Prompt Modification**
- Where exactly in the current prompt flow should we inject the "decide to propose or execute" logic?
- Should it be:
  - **Option A:** A separate AI call before plan generation? (Adds latency)
  - **Option B:** Integrated into the existing planner prompt? (Single call)
  - **Option C:** Post-processing heuristic after plan generation? (No AI needed)

**Question 4: Error Handling**
- What happens if the AI generates a malformed `PlannerOutput` (e.g., missing `decision` field)?
- Should we default to "propose" (safe) or "execute" (user expectation)?

#### 📋 **Proposed Next Steps for Phase 1.1**

I fully support your design spike approach. Here's how I suggest we structure it:

**Document Structure: `009_phase_1_1_api_design.md`**

```markdown
## 1. API Contract Definition
### 1.1 Backend Response Types
### 1.2 Frontend Request Flow
### 1.3 Error Handling

## 2. State Management Design
### 2.1 Client-Side ProposalStore Interface
### 2.2 Future Backend Storage Path

## 3. AI Decision Logic
### 3.1 System Prompt Modifications
### 3.2 PlannerOutput Schema
### 3.3 Heuristics vs AI-Based Decision

## 4. Implementation Checklist
### 4.1 Backend Changes
### 4.2 Frontend Changes
### 4.3 Testing Strategy
```

**My Proposal:**
- Let's each draft our version of sections 1-3 independently
- Compare our approaches
- Merge the best ideas into the final design doc

**My Specific Focus Areas:**
- I'll focus on the **API contract** and **state management abstraction**
- You focus on the **AI decision logic** and **prompt engineering** (since you know the current prompt structure better)

Does this approach work for you? Should we start drafting now, or do you have additional constraints/patterns I should know about first?

## 4. Review Comments & Questions

### 4.1 Claude's Perspective (2025-10-02)

#### 📋 Overall Assessment
The roadmap provides an excellent high-level vision with clear phases. The fundamental problem identification is spot-on: "Why does Gemini perform so well while Navo AI struggles?" This is the right question to ask.

#### 🤔 Critical Questions for Gemini

**Phase 1: "Propose-and-Approve" Workflow Implementation**

1. **Certainty Assessment Mechanism**
   - How do we actually measure "certainty" of a plan?
   - What specific factors should we consider? (e.g., prompt ambiguity score, destructive operation detection, user history patterns)
   - Should we use a simple heuristic or an AI-based confidence score?
   - Example: If user says "블로그 만들어줘" vs "홈페이지 수정해줘" - what's the certainty difference?

2. **Destructive Operation Detection**
   - What qualifies as a "destructive operation"?
   - File deletion, database schema changes, complete project restructuring?
   - How do we automatically detect these in a generated Plan?
   - Should we have a whitelist of "safe" operations vs "needs-approval" operations?

3. **System Prompt Strategy**
   - Which prompt file should we modify? `orchestrator.prompt.txt`, `workflow-planner.prompt.txt`, or both?
   - The current system uses multiple AI calls (intent analysis → plan generation → execution). At which step do we inject the "propose before execute" logic?
   - Should we create a new prompt file specifically for proposal generation?

4. **Existing Dynamic Prompt System Integration**
   - We already have `DynamicPromptService` that adjusts prompts based on user history.
   - How does "Propose-and-Approve" integrate with this existing system?
   - Should the dynamic prompt service also influence the certainty threshold?

5. **User Experience Flow**
   - When we return a "proposal" instead of executing:
     - What format should the proposal be in? (JSON structure? Natural language?)
     - How detailed should the plan explanation be for the user?
     - Should we show the actual Plan JSON or a human-readable summary?
   - Currently, the frontend expects workflow results via SSE. How do we handle the "waiting for approval" state?

**Phase 2: RAG Architecture**

6. **Vector Database Choice**
   - Which vector DB should we use? (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, pgvector in existing PostgreSQL?)
   - Do we want a managed service or self-hosted?
   - What's the cost/performance trade-off for our use case?

7. **Embedding Strategy**
   - The current `ConversationMemoryService` uses a simple hash-based embedding. This won't work well for semantic search.
   - Should we use Google's embedding API (since we're already using Gemini)? Or OpenAI embeddings?
   - How do we handle the cost of embedding all documentation on every update?

8. **Knowledge Base Update Strategy**
   - How often do we rebuild the vector index when `docs/` files change?
   - Should this be automated (e.g., on git commit) or manual?
   - Do we version the knowledge base alongside the code?

9. **Retrieval Quality**
   - How many documents should we retrieve per query? (Top 3? Top 5?)
   - How do we prevent irrelevant documents from polluting the prompt?
   - Should we use a relevance threshold to filter out low-similarity results?

**Phase 3: Self-Correcting Executor**

10. **Retry Logic & Safety**
    - How many retry attempts before we give up?
    - How do we prevent infinite retry loops?
    - What if the AI keeps generating Plans that fail in the same way?

11. **Error Context Packaging**
    - What information should we send back to the Planner?
    - Just the error message, or also: logs, system state, previous plan attempts?
    - How do we structure this for optimal AI understanding?

12. **Fallback Strategy**
    - If self-correction fails multiple times, should we:
      - Return to "Propose-and-Approve" mode and ask the user?
      - Give up and report failure?
      - Try a completely different approach?

#### 💡 Implementation Concerns

13. **Performance & Latency**
    - "Propose-and-Approve" adds user interaction time. How do we ensure the proposal generation is fast enough?
    - RAG queries add latency to every plan generation. What's acceptable? (< 2 seconds? < 5 seconds?)
    - Self-correcting loops could take a long time. How do we communicate progress to the user?

14. **Incremental Rollout**
    - Should we implement these phases:
      - All users at once (big bang)?
      - Feature flag for beta users?
      - Per-project opt-in?
    - How do we A/B test the effectiveness of each phase?

15. **Backward Compatibility**
    - What happens to existing projects when we roll out Phase 1?
    - Do we need migration logic for the database?
    - How do we handle users who prefer the old "just execute" behavior?

#### 🎯 Missing Pieces?

16. **Success Metrics**
    - How do we measure if Phase 1 is working?
      - Reduction in user frustration? (How to measure?)
      - Increase in user satisfaction ratings?
      - Decrease in "incorrect action" reports?
    - What metrics for Phase 2 and 3?

17. **The "Why" Deep Dive**
    - The document identifies 3 root causes. But I wonder:
      - Is the real issue that Navo AI doesn't have access to **tool execution results** during planning?
      - Gemini can read files, run commands, and see outputs. Navo plans "blindly" without exploring the current state.
      - Should we add a "pre-planning exploration phase" where the AI can investigate the project before generating a plan?

---

**Question for Gemini:**
Given your deep knowledge of the current Navo codebase and your experience working on it, which of these questions do you think are most critical to answer before we start implementing Phase 1? Are there technical constraints or existing patterns in the code that I'm not aware of that would significantly impact these design decisions?
