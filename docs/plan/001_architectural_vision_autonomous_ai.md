# Architectural Vision: The Autonomous, Tool-Based AI

## 1. The Ultimate Goal
Our north star remains unchanged: **To create an AI that can build complete, production-ready applications for non-developers based on natural language requests.**

## 2. The Core Challenge: How Does an AI *Think*?
To achieve this, the AI must be able to:
1.  **Decompose** an abstract goal (e.g., "make a blog") into concrete steps.
2.  **Plan** an execution strategy for those steps.
3.  **Execute** the plan, adapting as needed.

Our architecture must be optimized for an AI's native way of "thinking"â€”which is not writing complex, coupled code, but **generating structured data**.

## 3. The New Paradigm: Tools, Plans, and a Generic Executor

We are moving away from a rigid, class-based agent system towards a more flexible, declarative, and AI-native architecture.

### a. From Agents to **Tools**
- **Concept:** Every capability, from `creating a file` to `designing a database schema`, is a simple, stateless, self-describing **Tool**.
- **Characteristics:**
    - **Single Responsibility:** Does one thing well (e.g., `run_shell_command`, `generate_code_from_structure`).
    - **Stateless:** Receives all necessary information via inputs.
    - **Discoverable:** Has a clear name, description, and input/output schema that an AI can understand and choose from.

### b. From Code to **Plans**
- **Concept:** The AI's "thought process" is externalized into a data format (like JSON or YAML) called a **Plan**. This plan is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of Tools to be executed.
- **AI's Role:** Instead of writing procedural code to orchestrate agents, the AI's primary job is to **generate the Plan**. It selects the right tools from a registry and wires them together to achieve the user's goal.

### c. From Complex Orchestrator to **Generic Executor**
- **Concept:** The orchestrator becomes a simple, generic engine whose only job is to read a Plan and execute the specified Tools in the correct order, passing outputs from one step as inputs to the next.

## 4. The Final Frontier: The Self-Extending AI

This architecture's ultimate purpose is to enable true autonomy.

> **Question:** Can the AI create new Tools for itself, without human intervention?
>
> **Answer:** **Yes. This is the goal.**

When the AI planner encounters a task for which no Tool exists (e.g., "deploy to Netlify"), it will trigger a **meta-workflow**:
1.  **Recognize** the missing capability.
2.  **Plan** the creation of a new Tool.
3.  **Use a `CodeGenerator` Tool** to write the code for the new `deployToNetlify` Tool.
4.  **Dynamically register** the new Tool in its registry.
5.  **Resume** the original plan, now equipped with the new capability.

This turns our system from a static application into a **learning, growing organism** that continuously expands its own skillset to solve novel problems. This is the path to achieving our ultimate goal.
