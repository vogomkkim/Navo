# Navo Development Principles

This document outlines the core development principles and coding standards for all code generated by the Navo AI and written by human developers. The goal is to ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality across all projects. This document serves as the primary knowledge base for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

## 1. General Principles

### 1.1. Separation of Concerns (SoC)

**Rule:** Do not mix different types of logic (e.g., UI, business logic, data access, type definitions) in a single file.

**Why:** Separating concerns makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain. Each file should have a single, clear responsibility.

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** A single React component file that contains type definitions, API fetching logic, and state management.
- **Good:**
    - `MyComponent.tsx`: Contains only the UI logic.
    - `MyComponent.types.ts`: Contains all type definitions related to the component.
    - `useMyComponent.ts`: A hook that encapsulates the component's business logic and state.
    - `api.ts`: A dedicated file for API client and data fetching functions.

### 1.2. Componentization

**Rule:** Prioritize creating small, reusable components over building large, monolithic components. A component should ideally do one thing well.

**Why:** Small components are easier to test, reuse, and reason about. This leads to a more modular and scalable frontend architecture.

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** A single `UserProfile.tsx` page that contains the user's avatar, bio, post list, and settings, all in one file.
- **Good:**
    - `UserProfile.tsx`: The main page component that assembles the smaller components.
    - `Avatar.tsx`: A reusable component to display a user's avatar.
    - `BioEditor.tsx`: A component for editing the user's bio.
    - `PostList.tsx`: A component for displaying a list of posts.
