# Gemini's Summary of Navo's Multi-Agent System

This document summarizes the multi-agent system design and its components within the Navo project, based on the analysis performed by Gemini.

## 1. Overall Multi-Agent Architecture for NL Requests

The Navo project is in "Phase 2: Multi-Agent Integration Plan for Code Generation and Live Preview." The core idea is to apply a multi-agent architecture (NLP -> Plan -> Execute -> Verify -> Retry) to various stages of the code generation and live preview workflow.

**Key aspects of the multi-agent design:**

- **Proposed Architecture:** A sequence of specialized AI agents:
  1.  **Natural Language Processing/Refinement Agent:** Processes and refines the initial NL request.
  2.  **Planning Agent:** Converts the refined request into a concrete, executable plan.
  3.  **Execution Agent:** Executes the plan.
  4.  **Execution Result Verification Agent:** Verifies immediate results.
  5.  **Plan-Result Consistency Verification Agent:** Checks alignment with the original plan.
  6.  **Retry/Re-attempt Agent:** Initiates retries if errors occur.
  7.  **Result NL Conversion Agent:** Converts verified results back to natural language.
  8.  **Delivery Agent:** Delivers results to the user.

- **Application:** This multi-agent strategy is being applied to:
  - Project Scaffolding
  - Backend API Code Generation
  - Frontend UI Code Generation
  - Database Schema Auto-Execution & Deployment

## 2. Individual Agents and Their Roles (Implemented in `navo/agents/`)

The following agents are implemented and contribute to the multi-agent design, particularly in the context of automated error resolution:

- **`ErrorAnalyzerAgent.ts` (Priority 1 - Highest):**
  - **Role:** Analyzes errors using the Google Generative AI (Gemini API). It determines the error type, root cause, severity, and proposes a solution (including potential code changes).
  - **Contribution to NL Request Processing:** Acts as the initial "Natural Language Processing/Refinement Agent" and part of the "Planning Agent" for error resolution. It translates a raw error into a structured analysis and a plan for resolution.

- **`CodeFixerAgent.ts` (Priority 2):**
  - **Role:** Applies code changes based on the analysis and proposed solutions from the `ErrorAnalyzerAgent`. It handles specific fixable error types and generates code modifications (e.g., null checks, missing HTML elements). It also creates file backups before applying changes.
  - **Contribution to NL Request Processing:** A key part of the "Execution Agent" for code modification. It executes the structured "plan" (code changes) generated by the `ErrorAnalyzerAgent`.

- **`TestRunnerAgent.ts` (Priority 3):**
  - **Role:** Verifies whether an error has been resolved after code changes are applied. It attempts to reproduce the error, checks application health, and tests related functionalities. Includes retry mechanisms.
  - **Contribution to NL Request Processing:** Serves as the "Execution Result Verification Agent" and "Plan-Result Consistency Verification Agent." It verifies if the "execution" (code fix) has successfully resolved the original "NL request" (the error).

- **`RollbackAgent.ts` (Priority 4):**
  - **Role:** Reverts the codebase to its previous stable state using backups if a code fix fails or introduces new issues.
  - **Contribution to NL Request Processing:** The "Retry/Re-attempt Agent." It ensures system recovery if an automated fix fails, allowing for subsequent attempts or human intervention.

**Status:** These agents are implemented and are in progress of being fully integrated and refined within the larger multi-agent system.

## 3. DAG-Based Orchestration (Implemented in `navo/core/`)

The multi-agent system uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based execution engine as its "Orchestrator Layer."

- **Relationship to Agents:**
  - **Agents** (like the Planning Agent or Execution Agent) create a plan.
  - That **plan** is represented as a DAG.
  - A **DAG runner** executes the plan.

- **Core Components:**
  - **`node.ts`**: Defines the `GraphNode` interface, the fundamental unit of work in the graph. Each `GraphNode` has:
    - `name`: Unique identifier.
    - `deps?`: Optional array of names of dependent nodes.
    - `run`: An asynchronous function performing the node's work.
    - `NodeContext`: Provides access to logger, config, services, and outputs from previous nodes.

  - **`graph.ts`**: Contains utilities for graph structure management:
    - `validateDag(nodes: GraphNode[])`: Checks for cycles and missing dependencies.
    - `topologicalGroups(nodes: GraphNode[])`: Groups nodes into levels for concurrent execution using Kahn's algorithm.

  - **`runner.ts`**: Implements the `runGraph` function, the core execution engine:
    - Validates the DAG and computes topological groups.
    - Initializes an `outputs` map for node results.
    - Executes nodes concurrently within groups, respecting dependencies.
    - Includes timeout handling for individual node executions.
    - Logs execution status (start, done, fail).

**Summary of Orchestration:** The "Planning Agent" constructs a list of `GraphNode` objects, defining the sequence and dependencies of operations. The `runGraph` function then executes this DAG efficiently, handling dependencies, concurrency, and timeouts. Individual agents (like `CodeFixerAgent`) would implement the `run` method of specific `GraphNode` instances, performing their specialized tasks within this orchestrated flow. This provides a robust and observable way to manage complex, multi-step processes.
