Current Status Summary:

   * Application Core: The main application loads successfully, and the database schema has been applied.
   * API Connectivity: The API_URL environment variable is correctly configured, and the server can connect to the database.
   * AI Suggestions (Current Issue): We are currently working on implementing AI-generated suggestions. The server is successfully calling the Gemini API and receiving a
     response.
   * Immediate Problem: The server is failing to parse the AI's response because the AI is wrapping its JSON output in markdown code blocks (e.g.,  ``json ... `` ).
   * Last Attempted Fix: I tried to apply a fix to navo/server.ts to extract the raw JSON using a regular expression before parsing, but the replace tool failed due to
     strict matching.

  Next Steps for Future Session:

   1. Apply the JSON extraction fix: The immediate next step is to successfully apply the regex-based JSON extraction logic to the generateAiSuggestion function in
      navo/server.ts. I will use the write_file tool for this to ensure robustness.
   2. Test AI Suggestions: After the fix, restart the server and trigger the "Generate Dummy Suggestion" to see if AI suggestions are now correctly displayed.
