# UX Flow

Navo helps users go from idea to live product in minutes. The journey contains five steps.

## 1) Onboarding

- Provide purpose, target audience, and basic brand signals
- Pick a starter template
- Example verbs: "plan", "choose", "brand"

## 2) AI Project Generation

- Generate initial layout, copy, and images in ~10 seconds
- Show a preview with sections and placeholder content
- Example verbs: "generate", "preview", "skim"

## 3) Visual Editor

- Click‑to‑edit text and replace/upload images
- Adjust styles with sliders (typography, colors, spacing)
- Add, move, or remove sections; drag handles and controls
- Chat commands apply small edits with visible diffs
- Example verbs: "edit", "tweak", "rearrange", "chat"

## 4) Publish

- One‑click publish to a subdomain with SSL and CDN
- Show success URL and a short build log
- Keep the last 3 builds for rollback
- Example verbs: "publish", "share", "rollback"

## 5) Analytics & Suggestions

- Track `view` and `click` events; simple page insights
- Daily AI suggestion (style or copy) with one‑click apply
- Example verbs: "monitor", "improve", "apply"

## Non‑Goals

- Exposing code or infra options to end users
- Forcing tech choices; defaults should be good

See `README.md` for the canonical overview.
