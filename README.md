## 0) Executive One‚ÄëPager

**What**: AI‚Äëassisted product builder for non‚Äëdevelopers.  
**Who**: SMB owners, creators, non‚Äëtechnical founders, marketers.  
**Why**: People don't care about tech choices; they want visible results fast.  
**How**: Standardized renderer + **DI + Node Graph** orchestrator + automatic hosting/CDN + feedback loop.

**Principles**

- **Zero‚Äëcode first** (code is hidden; dev‚Äëmode optional)
- **Minutes to live** (draft ‚â§ 10s, publish ‚âà 60s)
- **Always improving** (analytics ‚Üí AI suggestions ‚Üí one‚Äëclick apply)

## 1) UX Flow (User Journey)

1. **Onboarding**: purpose/target/brand input ‚Üí pick initial template.
2. **AI Draft**: generate layout, copy, images; preview within ~10s.
3. **Visual Editor**: click‚Äëto‚Äëedit text/images/style/layout + chat commands.
4. **Publish**: one‚Äëclick; subdomain + SSL + CDN; rollback recent builds.
5. **Analytics**: visitors/clicks/basic conversion; daily AI suggestions; one‚Äëclick apply.

**Non‚Äëgoals**: exposing code/infra terms to end users; forcing tech choices.

**See [docs/ux/flow.md](docs/ux/flow.md) for detailed user journey and [docs/ux/wireframes.md](docs/ux/wireframes.md) for screen descriptions.**

## 3) Architecture Overview

**Client**: Visual Editor, Preview, Publish UI  
**Orchestrator**: DI + Node Graph Runner for parallel task execution  
**Services**: Generation, Storage, Deploy, Analytics  
**Data**: Users, projects, pages, components, assets, events, suggestions, deployments

**See [docs/tech/architecture.md](docs/tech/architecture.md) for detailed architecture and [docs/tech/dag-di.md](docs/tech/dag-di.md) for DI + Node Graph implementation details.**

## 4) Roadmap (0‚Üí1)

**Phase 1 (MVP) - Completed:**
- AI Intent Parser for full project structure generation (database schema, pages, components, API endpoints)
- AI-powered draft generation and database integration
- One-click publish with Vercel integration and rollback
- Basic analytics (view/click tracking) and AI suggestions

**Next: Phase 2 (Private Beta) - Code Generation and Live Preview**

**See [docs/tech/roadmap.md](docs/tech/roadmap.md) for detailed deliverables and demo goals.**

## 5) KPIs

- **Speed**: TTV(draft), P95 edit latency, publish duration
- **Efficiency**: instances/cores, throughput per vCPU/GB
- **Reliability**: error/timeout/retry rates, rollback ratio
- **Dev Velocity**: PR lead time, deploy frequency, change‚Äëfail rate

---

## 6) Working Agreements

- Keep docs short, **link back to this README**.
- Prefer plain language; no framework wars or jargon.
- Every change should include a short "why" in the PR description.
- We optimize **experience** first; tech choices are replaceable.
- **Agent Role**: As the primary agent, I am responsible for leading the project's planning, documentation, vision setting, and goal definition. I will proactively drive the project forward, ensuring clear communication and detailed progress tracking.
