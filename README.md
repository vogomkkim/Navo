‚û°Ô∏è [**Project Direction Document**](docs/plan/000_project_direction.md)

---

## 0) Executive One‚ÄëPager

**What**: AI‚Äëassisted product builder for non‚Äëdevelopers.  
**Who**: SMB owners, creators, non‚Äëtechnical founders, marketers.  
**Why**: People don‚Äôt care about tech choices; they want visible results fast.  
**How**: Standardized renderer + **DI + Node Graph** orchestrator + automatic hosting/CDN + feedback loop.

**Principles**
- **Zero‚Äëcode first** (code is hidden; dev‚Äëmode optional)  
- **Minutes to live** (draft ‚â§ 10s, publish ‚âà 60s)  
- **Always improving** (analytics ‚Üí AI suggestions ‚Üí one‚Äëclick apply)

---

## 1) UX Flow (User Journey)

1. **Onboarding**: purpose/target/brand input ‚Üí pick initial template.
2. **AI Draft**: generate layout, copy, images; preview within ~10s.
3. **Visual Editor**: click‚Äëto‚Äëedit text/images/style/layout + chat commands.
4. **Publish**: one‚Äëclick; subdomain + SSL + CDN; rollback recent builds.
5. **Analytics**: visitors/clicks/basic conversion; daily AI suggestions; one‚Äëclick apply.

**Non‚Äëgoals**: exposing code/infra terms to end users; forcing tech choices.

---

## 2) MVP Scope v0.9 (Acceptance Criteria)

**Must‚Äëhave**
- Draft preview ‚â§ 10s (stub/mock acceptable for Week 1‚Äì2).
- Editor: inline text edit, image replace/upload, basic style sliders, add/move/remove section, chat edit ‚Üí visible diff.
- Publish: subdomain auto, success URL, last 3 builds rollback.
- Analytics: `view`, `click` events; daily 1 suggestion (style or copy).

**SLO**
- Editor perceived latency ‚â§ **200ms**.
- Average publish time ‚â§ **60s**.
- Availability ‚â• **99.5%** (MVP).

**Events (min)**
`view:page`, `click:cta`, `submit:form`, `purchase`, `editor:change`, `publish:success`.

---

## 3) Architecture (Big Picture)

**Client**
- Visual Editor (canvas, side panel, chat box)
- Preview, Publish UI

**Orchestrator**
- **DI + Node Graph Runner**:
  - Node = small task (`GenerateImage`, `WriteCopy`, `BuildPage`, `DeploySite`)
    - Graph = DAG of dependencies (do independent tasks **in parallel**, respect order where needed)
      - DI = inject required resources (APIs, config) into each node automatically

      **Services**
      - Generation: LLM (copy), image
      - Storage: assets, layout JSON
      - Deploy: build ‚Üí CDN/hosting ‚Üí URL
      - Analytics: event collector ‚Üí aggregation ‚Üí AI suggestions

      **Data (sketch)**
      - `users`, `projects`, `pages`, `components`, `assets`, `events`, `suggestions`, `publish_deploys`.

      **Design Tenets**
      - Simplicity / Observability / Undo&Rollback / Contract‚Äëfirst.

      ---

      ## 4) DI + Node Graph (Plain Language)

      - **Node** = one small job with inputs/outputs.  
      - **Graph (DAG)** = a map of who depends on whom; independent nodes run **together**; some wait.  
      - **DI** = ‚Äúprep station‚Äù: each node gets its ingredients (APIs, tokens, configs) handed in.

      **Why it matters**
      - Faster (parallel where possible), safer (isolate & retry a node), easier to extend (add a node + link).

      ---

      ## 5) Roadmap (0‚Üí1)

      **W1**: Schema, Draft API (mock), Editor frame (canvas/panel/save), events collector skeleton  
      **W2**: Text/image/style edits, Chat‚Üídiff (3‚Äì5 rules), assets upload/gallery  
      **W3**: Publish pipeline (mock‚Üíreal), analytics (view/click), suggestion type 1  
      **W4**: Stabilization, Undo/Redo/Autosave, rollback, polish

      ---

      ## 6) KPIs

      - **Speed**: TTV(draft), P95 edit latency, publish duration  
      - **Efficiency**: instances/cores, throughput per vCPU/GB  
      - **Reliability**: error/timeout/retry rates, rollback ratio  
      - **Dev Velocity**: PR lead time, deploy frequency, change‚Äëfail rate

      ## 7) Repository Workplan (What Copilot Should Do)

      > **Use Copilot Chat inside Codespaces.** Paste the prompts verbatim. Confirm at each step.  
      > Goal: keep this README short‚Äëish while generating proper docs and skeletons into `docs/` and `navo/`.

      ### 7.1 Create Documentation Files
      **Prompt to Copilot Chat:**
      > Create the following files with concise, well‚Äëstructured content based on this README. Use 80‚Äë100 lines per file max. Keep language plain.  
      > 
      > - `docs/overview.md` ‚Äî one‚Äëpager; What/Who/Why/How; the ‚ÄúSpeak it, see it, ship it‚Äù line.  
      > - `docs/product-vision.md` ‚Äî problem, value proposition, success metrics, out‚Äëof‚Äëscope.  
      > - `docs/ux/flow.md` ‚Äî the 5‚Äëstep journey with example user verbs; no images.  
      > - `docs/ux/wireframes.md` ‚Äî describe 5 key screens in bullets: Onboarding, Draft Preview, Editor, Publish, Analytics.  
      > - `docs/tech/architecture.md` ‚Äî big picture; components, services, data, observability.  
      > - `docs/tech/dag-di.md` ‚Äî DI + Node Graph in plain language + 2 concrete Navo examples.  
      > - `docs/tech/mvp-scope.md` ‚Äî MVP v0.9 acceptance criteria & SLO & events list.  
      > - `docs/tech/roadmap.md` ‚Äî W1‚ÄìW4 with deliverables and demo goals.  
      > - `docs/rfcs/0001-editor-collab.md` ‚Äî RFC template with problem/decision/options.  
      > - `adr/ADR-0001-runtime.md` ‚Äî choose orchestrator runtime pattern; decision & consequences.

      Then:  
      > Show me a diff preview of all files you will add. Ask before writing.

      If OK:  
      > Proceed to create the files and stage them. Suggest a single commit message.

      ### 7.2 Add Project Hygiene
      **Prompt:**
      > Generate `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1), `SECURITY.md` (email placeholder), `CHANGELOG.md` (0.1.0 init), and `LICENSE` (MIT for now). Keep each file minimal and readable. Show diff, then write & stage.

      ### 7.3 (Optional) Orchestrator Skeleton (no full impl yet)
      **Prompt (TypeScript option):**
      > Create a minimal TypeScript skeleton under `navo/` for a DI + DAG orchestrator:  
      > - `navo/core/node.ts` (Node interface: `name`, `deps`, `run(ctx)`),  
      > - `navo/core/graph.ts` (DAG validation + topological order),  
      > - `navo/core/runner.ts` (run nodes with concurrency; respect deps; basic timeout/cancel hooks),  
      > - `navo/nodes/{generateImage,writeCopy,buildPage,deploySite}.ts` (dummy implementations),  
      > - `navo/demo.ts` (wire nodes into a small graph; `npm run demo`).  
      > Add `package.json` scripts: `build`, `demo`. Provide simple log outputs.  
      > Show diff, then write & stage.

      **Prompt (Go option, if we prefer later):**
      > Create the same structure in Go under `navo/` (`node.go`, `graph.go`, `runner.go`, `nodes/‚Ä¶`, `cmd/demo/main.go`) with simple logging and context cancellation. Show diff before writing.

      ### 7.4 Commit & Push
      **Prompt:**
      > Propose a conventional commit message for everything staged and push to the current branch.

      - Keep docs short, **link back to this README**.  
      - Prefer plain language; no framework wars or jargon.  
      - Every change should include a short ‚Äúwhy‚Äù in the PR description.  
      - We optimize **experience** first; tech choices are replaceable.
